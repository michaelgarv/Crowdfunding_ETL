# Crowdfunding_ETL
This project was completed by [Chelsea Pickett](https://github.com/michaelgarv/Crowdfunding_ETL/tree/main/Starter_Files/Chelsea) and [Michael Garverick.](https://github.com/michaelgarv/Crowdfunding_ETL/tree/main/Starter_Files/Chelsea) The [group notebook](https://github.com/michaelgarv/Crowdfunding_ETL/blob/main/Starter_Files/ETL_Mini_Project_MGarverick_CPickett.ipynb) shows the final product for all dataframes. All csv files, the final crowdfunding database .sql file, and a .png file of the ERD can be found in the [resources folder.](https://github.com/michaelgarv/Crowdfunding_ETL/tree/main/Starter_Files/Resources) 
# Category and Subcategory DataFrames 
The provided crowdfunding.xlsx file was extracted and transformed to create [category and subcategory dataframes.](https://github.com/michaelgarv/Crowdfunding_ETL/blob/main/Starter_Files/ETL_Mini_Project_MGarverick_CPickett.ipynb) Both dataframes were exported to csv files which can be found in the [resources](https://github.com/michaelgarv/Crowdfunding_ETL/tree/main/Starter_Files/Resources) folder. 
# Campaign DataFrame 
The provided crowdfunding.xlsx file was also used to create the [campaign dataframe.](https://github.com/michaelgarv/Crowdfunding_ETL/blob/main/Starter_Files/ETL_Mini_Project_MGarverick_CPickett.ipynb) The campaign dataframe was exported to a csv files which can be found in the [resources](https://github.com/michaelgarv/Crowdfunding_ETL/tree/main/Starter_Files/Resources) folder. 
# Contacts DataFrame
The provided contacts.xlsx file was extracted and transformed to create the [contacts dataframe](https://github.com/michaelgarv/Crowdfunding_ETL/blob/main/Starter_Files/ETL_Mini_Project_MGarverick_CPickett.ipynb) The contacts dataframe was exported to a csv file which can be found in the [resources](https://github.com/michaelgarv/Crowdfunding_ETL/tree/main/Starter_Files/Resources) folder. 
# Crowdfunding Database
The crowdfunding database was created by using the [QuickDBD](https://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com/) website to sketch a an [ERD](https://github.com/michaelgarv/Crowdfunding_ETL/blob/main/Starter_Files/Resources/crowdfunding_db_schema.png) of the tables and a table schema for each CSV file. The [crowdfunding database schema](https://github.com/michaelgarv/Crowdfunding_ETL/blob/main/Starter_Files/Resources/crowdfunding_db.sql) shows the correct table creation order, and evidence that all csv files were properly imported with a SELECT statement for each table.
